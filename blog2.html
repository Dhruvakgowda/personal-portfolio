        <p>
            Hey there! Hope you've put on your seatbelt cause this is gonna be a rough ride. I've always had thoughts like these but they aren't exactly the conversation you can have with friends or family on a Tuesday while drinking coffee, so here I am using the benefits of blogging to get it out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've always been fascinated with how dimensions work and are defined, so even as a kid I've always wondered what the 4D would look like. Being over-smart mere 3D human that I am, I just concluded that 4D couldn't possibly exist cause there were only 3 axis possible and that covers about everything. Simply obvious right?, But then I grew up and entered 10th grade where I found out you could use Google to search useful things too, did YOU know this?
And as every Google search does it redirected me to youtube for answers where smarter people than me tried to explain or draw a 4th dimension Cube which made some sense for that particular minute. But that 4D drawing meant nothing if I can't Perceive a 4D world.
As my "research" went on for a few days I stumbled upon a book called FLAT-LAND.
As funny as the name seams it was a beautiful book , it's about how a 2D world would function and how it would seem silly to our eyes.
In the tale of the book or the animated version to better understand the book.
A 2D man in the story is kind of like me :) who wonders if there's more to life, if there's something he's Missing in the world. 

        </p>
        <p>
            To better explain the 2D situation imagine a flat 2D blueprint of a building that architectes make. Now a circleÂ  who's also the main character of the story. If he wanted to go from one room to the other , while you can see the whole outline of house in one view, a 2D character can'tÂ  would have to travel all the way from his position to the destination following the drawn route , he can't jump up right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Now from a 3D perspective, a character could be a circle or a square or a triangle
But from a 2D perspectiveee they're all the same 
Cause all a 2D character can see is the width and not the height of anything.
Finally in the book a 3D character pulls up the 2D being to show him the world from his perspective and he's blown away by how he can see his entire world with 1 airal view. In the hype of the moment he desires to see more , the next dimension but the 3D character is out of answers who thought his dimension was the highest there is. Kind of like us? It is us? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway as I thought and thought and thought about what could be the dimension that would make the next dimension I realised. A 2D character can't Perceive 3D cause they can't move through height which is a linear property to them. They can't move through it freely,
What's the one thing in a 3D being's life that's linear and can never be changed/fastened/Slowed or reversed? Take a moment to think what's that one thing that controls us.
TIME , Time is the irreversible unchangeable property that controls a 3D person. Imagine you could move to the sky height and could see your whole life played out like on a Google spreadsheet? Give it a thought
The sheet's first index is your birth and the last is your death. You could see everything EVERYTHING that happens in your life like your education, who you marry, your career pathðŸ¤·. That's how a 4th dimension being would see your 3D life.

        </p>
        <p>
            Just a thought to buzz in your mind is .
Who is associated with "knowing everything about you and your life-path" and also supposedly lives in the sky? And is kind of Immortal from a human perspective???
GOD? Right? This'll take some time to sink in and I might get rioted by religious groups.
But to both religious people and atheists 
The GOD we know might just be a higher dimension being.
These are just opinions and putting so called research together. I don't mean to offend or question anyone's belives but all I'm saying is WHAT IF...?

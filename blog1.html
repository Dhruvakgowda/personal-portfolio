            <div class="blogpost">
                <p>
                    Hello there! Welcome to my first ever blog. This blog is about how I found out about neog.camp and what I did to crunch in the work in the short period of time I had in offer.
                </p>

                <p>A looong time ago, which is literally THREE days before the last submittion date of neog camps mark15 system. I had guests over for lunch and one of them was a SDE 2 at Microsoft itself.
                    As we started having small talk since we're children of the two families that met, I told him about how I've been trying to learn and understand concepts of Web development.
                    And just for reference when I'm having this conversation, I already have mini projects in Python, Html+css and javascript 
                    So I wasn't exactly at levelZero when it comes to programming (no pun intended). Once I told him about this he mentioned how one of his company employee has started a start-up or so that teaches web development in a bootcamp and immediately shared the link to the camp with me. I wasn't immediately interested as in 2021 every second startup is based on online learning. But an hour later I went to meet a friend who's basically also my only guide to this field as a whole. I mentioned about what had happened earlier and he immediately snapped 
                    As he knew what I was talking about and started complimenting the bootcamp which he was already familiar with. And the conversation we had in the next 1 hour hyped me up so much that as soon as I got home I hopped on my laptop and started watching the first video.
                    Since I was already pretty familiar with basic of javascript and html I dint have a hard time understanding it. But mann did "margin:auto" blow my mind, I've always struggled with the overflow issues while centre aligning something.
                </p>

                <p>3 sleepless nights later I was done with done till markNine expect for the blogs which is my last bit of work as I'm writing this. But it's been a great journey although only 3 and half days 
                    I'm greatful for the amount of knowledge I gained in such a short time. Will continue to learn regardless of getting selected to levelOne
                    As I don't hold high hopes of getting selected cause I've definitely had to compromise on design here and there to crunch in that much work in such a short time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all this said, I'm a Mechanical engineering student who's diving into this sea of CS sharks 
So if you're reading this for any reason and are looking for a reason or a sign to start learning ANYTHING AT ALL this is it my champ. Thank you for the opportunity.
                </p>
